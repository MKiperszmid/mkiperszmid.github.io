<p>Hey! I’m Martin. I’m a charismatic engineer who loves building apps.
I first got into programming when I was 15, around 2013. I learned C# at school, and between you and me, I hated it. 
1-to 2 years later, the password to one of my old emails got leaked, and I needed to change it on over 100 sites... great...
I proceeded to change the password, and after 10 sites I decided that was enough. I had to find a way to automate the process.
Good ol' programming was the solution. 
Spent the following weeks learning about requests and responses. How to make a desktop app where I could type a password, and it would update my old password on all sites with the new one
In the end, I made it work. Took me months, way more time than if I did it by hand. But it was still a huge achievement</p>
<p>Since then, I’ve been improving my skills and learning different languages and technologies like Android and Kotlin.  I even graduated as a System Analyst
The same kid who hated programming back then now loves it.
</p>

<p>Now I'm passionate about technology, programming, and everything that it can offer us. 
I love to keep myself up-to-date on the new technologies
Always willing to help and share my knowledge and experiences</p>
